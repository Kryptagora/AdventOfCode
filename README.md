Initialize a day by running `python build.py [day] [optional: year, default=2020]`.

A typical solution is a file containing the funcitons `part_1` and `part_2`, returning
respectively the solution to the given day.

Add testcases into the `examples.json` files, and test them with `pytest`.

Once the testcases run without problem,
submit with `python solve.py [day] [optional: year, default=2020]`
